<h2>Download a Census block shapefile into R</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Description from the US Census Bureau (see link for source): Census blocks are statistical areas
bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads,
streams, and railroad tracks, and by non-visible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county
limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Generally, census blocks are small in area;
for example, a block in a city. Census blocks in suburban and rural areas may be large, irregular and
bounded by a variety of features, such as roads, streams, and/or transmission line rights-of-way. In
remote areas census blocks may encompass hundreds of square miles. Census blocks cover all territory
in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island areas. Blocks do not cross the boundaries of any entity
for which the Census Bureau tabulates data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
blocks(state, county = NULL, year = NULL, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>state</code></td>
<td>
<p>The two-digit FIPS code (string) of the state you want. Can also
be state name or state abbreviation.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>county</code></td>
<td>
<p>The three-digit FIPS code (string) of the county you'd like to
subset for, or a vector of FIPS codes if you desire multiple counties.
Can also be a county name or vector of names.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>year</code></td>
<td>
<p>The year for which you'd like to download data (defaults to 2019).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>arguments to be passed to the underlying 'load_tiger' function, which is not exported.
Options include <code>class</code>, which can be set to <code>"sf"</code> (the default) or <code>"sp"</code> to
request sf or sp class objects, and <code>refresh</code>, which specifies whether or
not to re-download shapefiles (defaults to <code>FALSE</code>).</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function will download an entire block shapefile for a selected state
into R, and optionally subset by county. <strong>A warning:</strong> Census block
shapefiles are often very large, especially for large states - for example, the
block file for Texas is 462MB zipped!  If you have a slow or unreliable internet
connection, or insufficient memory, this may prove burdensome given that you
have to first download by state and then subset.
