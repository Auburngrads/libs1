__An analyst has fitted the Arrhenius-lognormal model__
$$
\Pr[T \leq t;\mathtt{temp}] = \Phi_{_{NOR}}  \left[\frac{\log_{10}(t)-\mu}{\sigma} \right] 
$$
__where $\mu = \beta_{0}+ \beta_{1} x$, where $\sigma$ is constant and $x=11605/(\mathtt{temp}\;K)$.  This differs from the model presented in Example 19.5 because base-10 logarithms have been used (something done quite commonly, and usefully, in engineering and other non-mathematical disciplines). Show how estimates of $\beta_{0}, \beta_{1}, \sigma,$ and $t_{p}$ in this model relate to estimates in the traditional base-$e$ lognormal distribution.__
