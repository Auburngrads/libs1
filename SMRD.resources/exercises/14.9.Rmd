__Consider the following quantities used in Exercise 14.7: $\bar{Y}$, $\mu$, $a_{1}$, and $b_{1}$.__ 

a. __Use the setting of Exercise 14.7 and these quantities to explain the important differences between variability and uncertainty in physical processes and statistical inference.__

a. __Explain how one could generalize the model in Exercise 14.7 to allow for batch-to-batch variability in the reliability of the electronic component and describe a sampling plan that could be used to combine prior information with data to estimate the parameters of this more general model.__
