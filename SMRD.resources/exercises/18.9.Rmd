__Consider a failure mechanism modeled with an underlying degradation path model in (18.3).  Suppose that the reaction activation energy is $E_{a}=1.8\;eV$.  For $\mathcal{R}_{U}=.2$ and $\mathcal{D}_{\infty}=.6$, compute the crossing times for all combinations of $t=1000, 2000$ hours and $\mathcal{D}_{f}=.5, 1$.  Use these results to verify that the SAFT property holds in this case.__
