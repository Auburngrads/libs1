__It has sometimes been suggested that one can (or even should) use degradation data to obtain failure-time (or crossing time) data to be used in analysis. Is this a good thing to do?  What are the trade-offs? How should one handle observations that have not yet crossed the boundary, but are close?  Refer to the data in Figure 21.1 to help formulate your answer.__
