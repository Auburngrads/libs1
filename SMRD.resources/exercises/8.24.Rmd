__Consider the problem described in Exercise 8.23 but suppose that the presumed distribution was lognormal with $\sigma=.55$.__

a. __Use the nonparametric method in Chapter 3 to obtain an approximate $95\%$ upper confidence bound for $F(500)$.__

a. __Use the nonparametric upper confidence bound from part (a) and the lognormal distribution assumption to obtain a $95\%$ lower confidence bound for the $.01$ quantile of the bearing life distribution.__
