__A mechanical adhesive has been designed for 10-year life at  $60 ^{\circ}C$ ambient temperature. Over time, the bond will degrade chemically and will eventually fail. The rate of the chemical reaction can be increased by testing at higher levels of temperature. Using an activation energy of $E_{a}=1.2\;eV$ and the Arrhenius relationship, calculate the time-acceleration factors for testing at $120^{\circ}C$, $90^{\circ}C$, and $80^{\circ}C$.__
