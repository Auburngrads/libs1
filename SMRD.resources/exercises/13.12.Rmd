__Suppose the actual degradation path of a particular unit is given by $\mathcal{D}(t) = \beta_{1} t$ where $\beta_{1}$ varies from unit to unit according to a $LOGNOR(\mu_{1}, \sigma_{1})$ distribution. Also suppose that failure occurs when $\mathcal{D}(t) > \mathcal{D}_f$, and $\mathcal{D}_f$ has a $LOGNOR(\mu_{2},\sigma_{2})$ distribution.  Derive an expression for $F(t)$, the failure time cdf.__
