__Suppose that failure time $T \sim \LOGNOR(\mu,\sigma)$ at a given level of temperature and that the Arrhenius model can be used to get a temperature/time acceleration factor as in (18.2). Then show that the logarithm of quantiles of the failure-time distribution will be a linear function of $1/(\mathtt{temp}\;^oC +273.15)$.__
