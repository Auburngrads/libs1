__Refer to Example 17.12 and Figure 17.13.  The two points corresponding to the subexperiments at 250 and 300 volts and $180^{\circ}C$ seem to be out of line from the other points. Use the individual subexperiment results given in Table 17.3 to compute a confidence interval for $t_{.5}$ at 300 volts and $180^{\circ}c$.  What does this suggest about the two outlying points?__
