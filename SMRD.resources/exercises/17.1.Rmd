__The confidence intervals for Example 17.3 given in Table 17.1 were computed by using the normal approximation method that is commonly used for censored data problems. For this data set, with the lognormal model, it is possible to use standard "exact" methods to compute confidence intervals for these parameters, based on a simple ordinary least squares regression relating the logarithms of execution time to system load.  Formulas for these exact methods are available in almost any elementary statistics text covering regression analysis.  Use a computer program to do the necessary least squares computations and compute, by hand, the "exact" confidence intervals.  Compare the estimates and confidence intervals. What is your conclusion?__
