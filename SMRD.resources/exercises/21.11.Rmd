__Design a computer program that can be used to simulate the results of an ADT experiment, using the model defined by (21.1), (21.2), and (21.3).  Write down all of the needed inputs. Then outline each step of the process, including the formulas that you would use to generate the needed random numbers, assuming that you have access to a uniform random number generator. Note that there are two stages of randomness in this "mixed-effect" model.__
