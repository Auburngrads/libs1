__The manufacturer of computer hard disks reports in its promotional literature an "MTBF" figure. This figure is obtained by taking a sample of units from each day's production, putting the units on test for a period $t_{c}$ (perhaps one week), pooling the available data over several months, and computing__
$$
 \widehat{MTBF} = \frac{TTT}{r} 
$$ 
__where $TTT$ is the total time on test of all units that were tested and $r$ is the observed number of failures (typically a very small number of drives).  Reported figures are typically numbers like MTBF=30 years.  Comment on the usefulness and validity of the use of this figure for characterizing the reliability of disk drives.__
