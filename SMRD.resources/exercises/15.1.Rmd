__Consider the bridge system structure in Figure 15.9. Assume that components 1, 2, 4, and 5 all have the same cdf $F(t)$. Plot $F_{T}(t)$ versus $0 < F(t) < 1 $ with a separate line for each value of $P(A_{3})= 0, .25, .5, .75$, and $1$. Comment on the results relative to the reliability of the two different series-parallel structures in Section 15.2.4.__
