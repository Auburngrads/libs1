__As an electronic device ages, its power output decreases.  Because the degradation results from a simple one-step chemical reaction with a limited amount of harmful material available for reaction, the decrease in power can be described by the degradation model $\mathcal{D}(t) = \beta_{2}[1 -  \exp(-\beta_{1} t )]$ where $\mathcal{D}(t)$ is the power output at time $t$, $\beta_{2} < 0$ is nearly the same for all units, and $\beta_{1}$, comes from a lognormal distribution.  System performance degrades noticeably when $\mathcal{D}(t)$ falls below $\mathcal{D}_t$. Thus we define a failure as the point in time when $\mathcal{D}(t) < \mathcal{D}_t$.__
