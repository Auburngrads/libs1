__A particular type of integrated circuit is thought to have a dominant failure mode with an activation energy of $E_{a}=1.2\;eV$.  This circuit is designed to operate at $50^{\circ}C$.  If a 1000-hour life test is conducted at $120^{\circ}C$, under the Arrhenius relationship, what is the equivalent amount of operating time for this failure mode?__
