__An electronic system contains 20 copies of a particular integrated circuit that is at risk to failure during operation.  The manufacturer of the component claims that the component's average hazard rate over the first two years of operation is 75 FITs.  For the 1500 systems that are currently in operation, compute a prediction for the total number of these integrated circuits that will fail over the next two years of operation.__
