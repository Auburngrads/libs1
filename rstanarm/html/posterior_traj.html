<h2>Estimate the subject-specific or marginal longitudinal trajectory</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows us to generate an estimated longitudinal trajectory 
(either subject-specific, or by marginalising over the distribution of the 
group-specific parameters) based on draws from the posterior predictive 
distribution.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
posterior_traj(object, m = 1, newdata = NULL, interpolate = TRUE,
  extrapolate = FALSE, prob = 0.95, ids, control = list(),
  return_matrix = FALSE, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>A fitted model object returned by the 
<code><a href="stan_jm.html">stan_jm</a></code> modelling function. See 
<code><a href="stanreg-objects.html">stanreg-objects</a></code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>m</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer specifying the number or name of the submodel</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>newdata</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optionally, a data frame in which to look for variables with
which to predict. If omitted, the model matrix is used. If <code>newdata</code>
is provided and any variables were transformed (e.g. rescaled) in the data
used to fit the model, then these variables must also be transformed in
<code>newdata</code>. This only applies if variables were transformed before
passing the data to one of the modeling functions and <em>not</em> if
transformations were specified inside the model formula.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>interpolate</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical specifying whether to interpolate the estimated 
longitudinal trajectory in between the observation times. This can be used
to achieve a smooth estimate of the longitudinal trajectory across the 
entire follow up time. If <code>TRUE</code> then the interpolation can be further 
controlled using the <code>control</code> argument.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>extrapolate</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical specifying whether to extrapolate the estimated 
longitudinal trajectory beyond the time of the last known observation time.
If <code>TRUE</code> then the extrapolation can be further controlled using
the <code>control</code> argument.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>prob</code></td>
<td>
<p>A scalar between 0 and 1 specifying the width to use for the 
uncertainty interval (sometimes called credible interval) for the predicted
mean response and the prediction interval for the predicted (raw) response. 
For example <code>prob = 0.95</code> (the default) means that the 2.5th and 97.5th  
percentiles will be provided. Only relevant when <code>return_matrix</code> is 
<code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ids</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional vector specifying a subset of subject IDs for whom the 
predictions should be obtained. The default is to predict for all individuals
who were used in estimating the model or, if <code>newdata</code> is specified,
then all individuals contained in <code>newdata</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>control</code></td>
<td>
<p>A named list with parameters controlling the interpolation or
extrapolation of the estimated longitudinal trajectory when either 
<code>interpolate = TRUE</code> or <code>extrapolate = TRUE</code>. The 
list can contain one or more of the following named elements: <br />
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>ipoints</code></dt><dd><p>a positive integer specifying the number of discrete 
time points at which to calculate the estimated longitudinal response for
<code>interpolate = TRUE</code>. These time points are evenly spaced starting at 
0 and ending at the last known observation time for each individual. The
last observation time for each individual is taken to be either: the
event or censoring time if no new data is provided; the time specified
in the &quot;last_time&quot; column if provided in the new data (see <strong>Details</strong>
section below); or the time of the last longitudinal measurement if new
data is provided but no &quot;last_time&quot; column is included. The default is 15.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>epoints</code></dt><dd><p>a positive integer specifying the number of discrete 
time points at which to calculate the estimated longitudinal response for
<code>extrapolate = TRUE</code>. These time points are evenly spaced between the 
last known observation time for each individual and the extrapolation 
distance specifed using either <code>edist</code> or <code>eprop</code>.
The default is 15.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>eprop</code></dt><dd><p>a positive scalar between 0 and 1 specifying the 
amount of time across which to extrapolate the longitudinal trajectory,
represented as a proportion of the total observed follow up time for each
individual. For example specifying <code>eprop = 0.2</code> means that for an
individual for whom the latest of their measurement, event or censoring times
was 10 years, their estimated longitudinal trajectory will be extrapolated 
out to 12 years (i.e. 10 + (0.2 * 10)). The default value is 0.2.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>edist</code></dt><dd><p>a positive scalar specifying the amount of time 
across which to extrapolate the longitudinal trajectory for each individual,
represented in units of the time variable <code>time_var</code> (from fitting the
model). This cannot be specified if <code>eprop</code> is specified.</p>
</dd> 
</dl>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>return_matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical. If <code>TRUE</code> then a <code>draws</code> by 
<code>nrow(newdata)</code> matrix is returned which contains all the actual
simulations or draws from the posterior predictive distribution. Otherwise
if <code>return_matrix</code> is set to <code>FALSE</code> (the default) then a 
data frame is returned, as described in the <strong>Value</strong> section below.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>posterior_traj</code> function acts as a wrapper to the 
<code><a href="posterior_predict.stanreg.html">posterior_predict</a></code> function, but allows predictions to be 
easily generated at time points that are interpolated and/or extrapolated 
between time zero (baseline) and the last known survival time for the 
individual, thereby providing predictions that correspond to a smooth estimate
of the longitudinal trajectory (useful for the plotting via the associated
<code><a href="plot.predict.stanjm.html">plot.predict.stanjm</a></code> method). In addition it returns a data 
frame by default, whereas the <code><a href="posterior_predict.stanreg.html">posterior_predict</a></code> function 
returns a matrix; see the <strong>Value</strong> section below for details. Also,
<code>posterior_traj</code> allows predictions to only be generated for a subset
of individuals, via the <code>ids</code> argument.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>When <code>return_matrix = FALSE</code>, a data frame 
of class <code>predict.stanjm</code>. The data frame includes a column for the median 
of the posterior predictions of the mean longitudinal response (<code>yfit</code>),
a column for each of the lower and upper limits of the uncertainty interval
corresponding to the posterior predictions of the mean longitudinal response 
(<code>ci_lb</code> and <code>ci_ub</code>), and a column for each of the lower and upper
limits of the prediction interval corresponding to the posterior predictions
of the (raw) longitudinal response. The data frame also includes columns for
the subject ID variable, and each of the predictor variables. The returned
object also includes a number of attributes.
</p>
<p>When <code>return_matrix = TRUE</code>, the returned object is the same as that 
described for <code><a href="posterior_predict.stanreg.html">posterior_predict</a></code>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>

  # Run example model if not already loaded
  if (!exists("example_jm")) example(example_jm)
  
  # Obtain subject-specific predictions for all individuals 
  # in the estimation dataset
  pt1 &lt;- posterior_traj(example_jm, interpolate = FALSE, extrapolate = FALSE)
  head(pt1)
  
  # Obtain subject-specific predictions only for a few selected individuals
  pt2 &lt;- posterior_traj(example_jm, ids = c(1,3,8))
  
  # If we wanted to obtain subject-specific predictions in order to plot the 
  # longitudinal trajectories, then we might want to ensure a full trajectory 
  # is obtained by interpolating and extrapolating time. We can then use the 
  # generic plot function to plot the subject-specific predicted trajectories
  # for the first three individuals. Interpolation and extrapolation is 
  # carried out by default.
  pt3 &lt;- posterior_traj(example_jm)
  head(pt3) # predictions at additional time points compared with pt1 
  plot(pt3, ids = 1:3)
  
  # If we wanted to extrapolate further in time, but decrease the number of 
  # discrete time points at which we obtain predictions for each individual, 
  # then we could specify a named list in the 'control' argument
  pt4 &lt;- posterior_traj(example_jm, control = list(ipoints = 10, epoints = 10, eprop = 0.5))
  
  # Alternatively we may want to estimate the marginal longitudinal
  # trajectory for a given set of covariates. To do this, we can pass
  # the desired covariate values in a new data frame (however the only
  # covariate in our fitted model was the time variable, year). To make sure  
  # that we marginalise over the random effects, we need to specify an ID value
  # which does not correspond to any of the individuals who were used in the
  # model estimation. (The marginal prediction is obtained by generating 
  # subject-specific predictions using a series of random draws from the random 
  # effects distribution, and then integrating (ie, averaging) over these. 
  # Our marginal prediction will therefore capture the between-individual 
  # variation associated with the random effects.)
  nd &lt;- data.frame(id = rep("new1", 11), year = (0:10 / 2))
  pt5 &lt;- posterior_traj(example_jm, newdata = nd)
  head(pt5)  # note the greater width of the uncertainty interval compared 
             # with the subject-specific predictions in pt1, pt2, etc
  
  # Alternatively, we could have estimated the "marginal" trajectory by 
  # ignoring the random effects (ie, assuming the random effects were set 
  # to zero). This will generate a predicted longitudinal trajectory only
  # based on the fixed effect component of the model. In essence, for a 
  # linear mixed effects model (ie, a model that uses an identity link 
  # function), we should obtain a similar point estimate ("yfit") to the
  # estimates obtained in pt5 (since the mean of the estimated random effects
  # distribution will be approximately 0). However, it is important to note that
  # the uncertainty interval will be much more narrow, since it completely
  # ignores the between-individual variability captured by the random effects.
  # Further, if the model uses a non-identity link function, then the point
  # estimate ("yfit") obtained only using the fixed effect component of the
  # model will actually provide a biased estimate of the marginal prediction.
  # Nonetheless, to demonstrate how we can obtain the predictions only using 
  # the fixed effect component of the model, we simply specify 're.form = NA'. 
  # (We will use the same covariate values as used in the prediction for 
  # example for pt5).
  pt6 &lt;- posterior_traj(example_jm, newdata = nd, re.form = NA)
  head(pt6)  # note the much narrower ci, compared with pt5
