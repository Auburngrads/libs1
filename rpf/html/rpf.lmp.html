<h2>Create logistic function of a monotonic polynomial (LMP) model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This model is a dichotomous response model originally proposed by
Liang (2007) and is implemented using the parameterization by
Falk &amp; Cai (in press).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
rpf.lmp(k = 0, multidimensional = FALSE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>a non-negative integer that controls the order of the
polynomial (2k+1) with a default of k=0 (1st order polynomial = 2PL).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>multidimensional</code></td>
<td>
<p>whether to use a multidimensional model.
Defaults to <code>FALSE</code>. The multidimensional version is not yet
available.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The LMP model replaces the linear predictor part of the
two-parameter logistic function with a monotonic polynomial,
<i>m(theta, omega, alpha, tau)</i>,
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>P(pick=1|omega,xi,alpha,tau,th) = 1/(1+exp(-(xi + m(theta,omega,xi,alpha,tau))))</i></p>

<p>where <i>alpha</i> and <i>tau</i> are vectors
of length k.
</p>
<p>The order of the polynomial is always odd and is controlled by
the user specified non-negative integer, k. The model contains
2+2*k parameters and are used as input to the <code>rpf.prob</code>
function in the following order:
<i>omega</i> - the natural log of the slope of the item model when k=0,
<i>xi</i> - the intercept,
<i>alpha</i> and <i>tau</i> - two parameters that control bends in
the polynomial. These latter parameters are repeated in the same order for
models with k&gt;1. For example, a k=2 polynomial with have an item
parameter vector of: <i>
omega, xi, alpha1, tau1, alpha2, tau2</i>.
</p>
<p>See Falk &amp; Cai (in press) for more details as to how the
polynomial is constructed. In general, the polynomial looks like the
following, but coefficients, b, are not directly estimated, but
are a function of the item parameters.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>m(theta) = xi + b_1*theta + b_2*theta^2 + &hellip; + b_(2k+1)*theta^{2k+1}</i></p>

<p>At the lowest order polynomial (k=0) the model reduces to the
two-parameter logistic (2PL) model. However, parameterization of the
slope parameter, <i>omega</i>, is currently different than
the 2PL (i.e., slope = exp(<i>omega</i>)). This parameterization
ensures that the response function is always monotonically increasing
without requiring constrained optimization.
</p>
<p>Please note that the functions implementing this item model
may eventually be replaced or subsumed by an alternative
item model. That is, backwards compatability will not necessarily
be guaranteed and this item model should be considered experimental
until further notice.
</p>
<p>For example, Falk &amp; Cai present a polytomous item model derived from
the generalized partial credit model that also uses a monotonic
polynomial as the linear predictor, referred to as a GPC-MP item
model. Since the GPC-MP reduces to the LMP when the number of
categories is 2, this is a potential candidate for replacing the
LMP item model. An alternative may include the retention of a
dichotomous response model, but with a lower (and upper)
asymptote that further reduces to the three-parameter logistic
(or four-parameter logistic) item model when k=0. Finally,
future versions may reparameterize <i>omega</i>, or allow
the option to release constraints on monotonicity. For instance,
releasing constraints on <i>omega</i> may be desirable
in cases where the user wishes to have the option of a
monotonically decreasing response function. Further releasing
constraints on <i>tau</i> would allow nonmontonicity and would
be equivalent to replacing the linear predictor with a polynomial.
