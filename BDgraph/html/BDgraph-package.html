<h2> Bayesian Structure Learning in Graphical Models </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>R</code> package <span class="pkg">BDgraph</span> provides statistical tools for Bayesian structure learning in undirected graphical models.      
The package is implemented the recent improvements in the Bayesian graphical models literature, including Mohammadi and Wit (2015), Mohammadi et al. (2017), and Dobra and Mohammadi (2017).
The computationally intensive tasks of the package are implemented in parallel using <span class="pkg">OpenMP</span> in <code>C++</code> and interfaced with <code>R</code>, to speed up the computations. 
Besides, the package contains several functions for simulation and visualization, as well as three multivariate datasets taken from the literature.
</p>

</p>

## Not run: 

library( BDgraph )

# Generating multivariate normal data from a 'random' graph
data.sim &lt;- bdgraph.sim( n = 70, p = 6, size = 7, vis = TRUE )

# Running algorithm based on GGMs
bdgraph.obj &lt;- bdgraph( data = data.sim, iter = 5000 )

summary( bdgraph.obj )

# To compare the result with true graph
compare( data.sim, bdgraph.obj, colnames = c("True graph", "BDgraph"), vis = TRUE )

# Running algorithm based on GGMs and marginal pseudo-likelihood
bdgraph.obj_mpl &lt;- bdgraph.mpl( data = data.sim, iter = 5000 )

summary( bdgraph.obj_mpl )

# To compare the results of both algorithms with true graph
compare( data.sim, bdgraph.obj, bdgraph.obj_mpl, 
         colnames = c( "True graph", "BDgraph", "BDgraph_mpl" ), vis = TRUE )
