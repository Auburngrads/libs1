<h2>Explore Corpus Term Frequency Characteristics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Explore Zipf's law and Heaps' law, two empirical laws in linguistics
describing commonly observed characteristics of term frequency
distributions in corpora.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Zipf's law (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law</a>)
states that given some corpus of natural language utterances, the
frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the
frequency table, or, more generally, that the pmf of the term
frequencies is of the form <i>c k^{-&beta;}</i>, where <i>k</i> is the
rank of the term (taken from the most to the least frequent one).
We can conveniently explore the degree to which the law holds by
plotting the logarithm of the frequency against the logarithm of the
rank, and inspecting the goodness of fit of a linear model.
</p>
<p>Heaps' law (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaps%27_law">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaps%27_law</a>)
states that the vocabulary size <i>V</i> (i.e., the number of different
terms employed) grows polynomially with the text size <i>T</i> (the
total number of terms in the texts), so that <i>V = c T^&beta;</i>.
We can conveniently explore the degree to which the law holds by
plotting <i>\log(V)</i> against <i>\log(T)</i>, and inspecting the
goodness of fit of a linear model.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The coefficients of the fitted linear model.  As a side effect, the
corresponding plot is produced.
