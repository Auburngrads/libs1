__The engineers who collected the IC data from Example 11.14 felt that if the life test had been extended for another 50,000 hours (corresponding to the technological life of the application system), only another 2 or 3 failures might have been observed.  Use this information to construct several Weibull and lognormal probability plots for the failure-time distribution for the defective subpopulation.__
