__Although the diesel generator fan failure times in Appendix Table C.1 were reported as exact failures, the ties suggest that the data are really discrete due to rounding or because failures were found on inspection. Suggest appropriate partitioning of the time line to reflect the true discrete nature of the data. Explain how you arrived at this partitioning.  Use this partitioning to develop an expression for the discrete-data likelihood.__
