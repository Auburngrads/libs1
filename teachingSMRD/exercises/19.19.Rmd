__In Example 19.11, there is evidence that $\sigma$ differs from one level of temperature to the other.__

a. __Suppose that $\sigma$ is really changing (as suggested by the point estimates) describe the effect that using a constant $\sigma$ model would have on estimates of the life distribution at $100^{o}C$. You do not need to do any numerical  computations; answer using intuition or analytical arguments.__

a. __With reference to the simple Arrhenius-lognormal failure-time model described in Sections 18.3.1 and 18.3.3, suggest possible physical reasons (i.e., deviations from the simple model) that might cause $\sigma$ to change as a function of temperature.__
