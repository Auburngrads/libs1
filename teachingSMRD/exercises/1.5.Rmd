__An important part of quantifying product reliability is the specification of an appropriate time-scale (or time-scales) on which life should be measured (e.g. hours of operation, cycles of operation, etc.).  For each of the following products, suggest and give reasons for an appropriate scale (or scales) upon which one might measure life.  Also, discus possible environmental factors that might affect the lifetime of individual units.__

It is important to consider the failure mechanism when determining an appropriate time scale. The time scale should have a direct relationship to the way the unit under consideration progresses toward failure. Some products do not have a simple single time scale (often because there is more than one underlying failure mechanism). See the answers to 1.6.
