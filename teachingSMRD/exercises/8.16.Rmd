__Consider a sample of $n$ observations with  $t_{1} \ldots, t_{r}$ reported as exact failure times (suppose that $2 \leq r \leq n$) and $n-r$ observations censored at a common time  $t_{c}$. Provide a simple expression for the Weibull log likelihood  in the $\eta=\exp(\mu)$ and $\beta=1/\sigma$ parameterization.__
