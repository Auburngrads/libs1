__Use the heat exchanger tube crack data in Figure 1.7 to do the following:__

a. __Fit an exponential distribution to the data. (Note that this could be done by fitting a Weibull distribution with $\beta$ constrained to be 1.)__

`r teachingSMRD:::solution()$begin`
`r teachingSMRD:::solution()$end`

a. __Fit a Weibull distribution to the data.__

`r teachingSMRD:::solution()$begin`
`r teachingSMRD:::solution()$end`

a. __Compare the values of the log likelihood from the two different distributions. How do they compare and what does this suggest?__

`r teachingSMRD:::solution()$begin`
`r teachingSMRD:::solution()$end`
