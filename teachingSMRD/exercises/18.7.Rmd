__A certain kind of capacitor has an exponential life distribution with a median life of 10 thousand hours at operating voltage of 400 volts. The relationship between life and voltage can be described by the inverse power relationship with an exponent $\beta=-10$. Determine the time-acceleration factors for accelerated testing of these capacitors at 500 volts, 600 volts, and 800 volts.__
