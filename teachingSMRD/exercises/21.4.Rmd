__When iterative techniques are used for maximum likelihood estimation, there is always some chance that the iterations will not converge to the actual maximum.  As described in Section 17.5.4, two precautions that will improve the probability of success are to use a parameterization that does not result in highly correlated parameter estimates and to have good starting values for the iterations. In most cases, the best way to get good starting values is to find simple graphical or moment-based estimates (e.g., estimates based on sample means and variances).  For the accelerated degradation model described by (21.2) and (21.3), and the corresponding data from Example 21.1, suggest expressions that can be used to obtain starting values for the approximate ML estimation algorithm.__
