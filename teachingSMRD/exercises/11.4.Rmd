__Refer to Exercise 11.3.  Show that the likelihood for the LFP model with a single censoring time can be factored into two components, one a binomial with parameter $\pi=p \times \Phi\{[\log(t_{c})-\mu]/\sigma\}$ and another consisting of a right-truncated failure time distribution with truncation time $\tau_{i}^{U}=t_{c}$.__
