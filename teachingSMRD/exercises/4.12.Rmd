__The exponential distribution is said to possess a "memoryless" property.  This memoryless property implies that a used unit is just as reliable as one that is new---that there is no wear out. Probabilistically this memoryless property can be stated as $\Pr(T \leq \delta) = \Pr(T \leq t_{0}+ \delta|T>t_{0})$ for any $t_{0}>0$. Show that for a continuous random variable, this memoryless property holds if and only if $T \sim EXP(\theta)$.__
