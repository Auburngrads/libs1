__A new computer-based home entertainment system will require 16 megabytes of RAM to run the operating system, store needed information for quick access, and other tasks.  The product designers can use a single 16 megabyte chip or four 4 megabyte chips, the latter option being $30\%$ less expensive. The manufacturers of the memory claim that the average fit rate for 2 years at normal operating conditions is 10 fits/per chip for all of their memory chips. Compare the reliability of the memory system for the two different design options.__
