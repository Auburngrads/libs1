__Suppose that failure time $T \sim \WEIB(\mu,\sigma)$ at a given level of voltage and that the inverse power relationship can be used to get a voltage/time acceleration factor as in (18.9). Then show that the logarithm of quantiles of the failure-time distribution will be a linear function of $\log({\rm Voltage})$.__
