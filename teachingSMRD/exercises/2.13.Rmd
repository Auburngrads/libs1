__Show that the pdf, cdf, survival, hazard, and cumulative hazard are mathematically equivalent descriptions of a continuous distribution in the sense that given any of these functions the other four are completely determined__

`r teachingSMRD:::solution()$begin`
Need to show that if we're given any one of these five functions we can obtain the others from it, i.e.

$$
f_{_X}(x) \rightarrow F_{_X}(x) \rightarrow S_{_X}(x)  \rightarrow h_{_X}(x) \rightarrow H_{_X}(x) \rightarrow f_{_X}(x)
$$

For this exercise suppose we know the functional form of the pdf, $f_{_X}(x)$.

$$
 \begin{aligned}
F_{_X}(x)&= \int_{0}^{x} f_{_X}(t) \, dt\\
S_{_X}(x)&= 1-F_{_X}(x)\\
h_{_X}(x)&= \frac{d}{dx}\log\left[S_{_X}(x) \right]\\
H_{_X}(x)&= \int_{0}^{x} h_{_X}(t) \, dt\\
f_{_X}(x)&= -\frac{d}{dx}\exp\left[-H_{_X}(x)\right]\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Since we can obtain any of these functions, regardless of which function we are initially given, we have obtained the desired result.
