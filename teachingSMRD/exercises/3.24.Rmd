__Consider the pooled heat exchanger data from all three plants in Figure 3.4__

a. __Write the likelihood for these data in terms of $\pi_{1},\pi_{2},\pi_{3},$ _and_ $\pi_{4}$__

`r teachingSMRD:::solution()$begin`
In terms of $\boldsymbol{\pi}=(\pi_{1},\pi_{2},\pi_{3},\pi_{4})$, the likelihood can be written as

$$
\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\pi})=C[\pi_{1}]^4[\pi_{2}]^5[\pi_{3}]^2[\pi_{2}+\pi_{3}+\pi_{4}]^{99}[\pi_{3}+\pi_{4}]^{95}[\pi_{4}]^{95}
$$

where $C$ is a constant that does not depend on $\mathbf{\pi}$.
`r teachingSMRD:::solution()$end`

b. __Write the likelihood for these data in terms of $p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},$ _and_ $p_{4}$__

`r teachingSMRD:::solution()$begin`
In terms of $\mathbf{p}=(p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},p_{4})$, the likelihood can be written as

$$
\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{p})=\mathcal{C}[p_{1}]^4[p_{2}(1-p_{1})]^5[p_{3}(1-p_{1})(1-p_{2})]^2[(1-p_{1})(1-p_{2})(1-p_{3})]^{95}[(1-p_{1})(1-p_{2})]^{99}[1-p_{1}]^{99}
$$

because $p_{4}=1$ in this case.
