__Suppose the actual degradation path of a particular unit is given by $\mathcal{D}(t) = \beta_{1} t$ where $-\log(\beta_{1})$ varies from unit to unit according to a $SEV(\mu, \sigma)$ distribution. If failure occurs when $\mathcal{D}(t) > \mathcal{D}_t$, where $\mathcal{D}_t$ is a fixed constant, show that the failure time distribution is Weibull.__
