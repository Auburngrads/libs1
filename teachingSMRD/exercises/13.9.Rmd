__Appendix Table C.18 gives degradation data on block error rates (the ratio of number of bytes with errors to the total number of bytes tested) of magneto-optic data storage disks tested for $2000$ hours at $80^{\circ}C$ and $85\%$ relative humidity. Use the simple analysis method described in Section 13.9 to estimate the failure-time distribution of these disks at $80^{\circ}C$ and $85\%$ relative humidity where failure is defined as the time that it takes to reach an error rate of $50 \times 10^{-5}$ (a safe level at which error correcting codes can be expected to correct errors).__
