<h2> Takeuchi's Information Criterion </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the Takeuchi information criterion
for a fitted model object
for which a log-likelihood value has been obtained.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
    TIC(object, ...)
    TICvlm(object, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>object</code></td>
<td>

<p>A <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> object having
class <code><a href="vglm-class.html">vglm-class</a></code>.
</p>

</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>Other possible arguments fed into
<code>logLik</code> in order to compute the log-likelihood.
</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following formula is used for VGLMs:
<i>-2*log-likelihood
    + 2 * trace(V K)</i>,
where <i>V</i> is the inverse of the EIM from the fitted model,
and <i>K</i> is the outer product of the score vectors.
Both <i>V</i> and <i>K</i> are order-<i>p.VLM</i> matrices.
One has <i>V</i> equal to <code>vcov(object)</code>,
and <i>K</i> is computed by taking the outer product of
the output from the <code>deriv</code> slot multiplied by the
large VLM matrix and then taking their sum.
Hence for the huge majority of models,
the penalty is computed at the MLE and is empirical in nature.
Theoretically, if the fitted model is the true model then
AIC equals TIC.
</p>
<p>When there are prior weights the score vectors are divided
by the square root of these,
because <i> (a_i U_i / &radic;{a_i})^2 = a_i U_i^2</i>.
</p>

<p>This code relies on the log-likelihood being defined, and computed,
for the object.
When comparing fitted objects, the smaller the TIC, the better the fit.
The log-likelihood and hence the TIC is only defined up to an additive
constant.
</p>
<p>Currently
any estimated scale parameter (in GLM parlance) is ignored by
treating its value as unity.
Also,
currently
this function is written only for <code><a href="vglm.html">vglm</a></code> objects and
not <code><a href="vgam.html">vgam</a></code> or <code><a href="rrvglm.html">rrvglm</a></code>, etc., objects.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a numeric TIC value.
</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>This code has not been double-checked.
The general applicability of <code>TIC</code> for the VGLM/VGAM classes
has not been developed fully.
In particular, <code>TIC</code> should not be run on some <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family
functions because of violation of certain regularity conditions, etc.
</p>
<p>Some authors note that quite large sample sizes are needed
for this IC to work reasonably well.
</p>




<h3>Note</h3>

<p>TIC has not been defined for RR-VGLMs, QRR-VGLMs, etc., yet.
</p>
<p>See <code><a href="AICvlm.html">AICvlm</a></code> about models
such as <code><a href="posbernoulli.tb.html">posbernoulli.tb</a></code>
that require <code>posbinomial(omit.constant = TRUE)</code>.
